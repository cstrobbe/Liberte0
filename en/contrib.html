        <h2>Translating, Transcribing and Captioning</h2>
        <p>Many documents on our website would be worth translating into other languages (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> English and Spanish), 
          and many external documents might be added to the website if someone translated them first.
        </p>
        <p>It is also possible to contribute transcripts or captions (subtitles for the hard of hearing)
          for videos in order to make this type of resources accessible.

        <h2>Help Prepare Events</h2>
        <p>The members of this group regularly oganise or participate in events, 
          especially by running a booth, making presentations and giving workshops at conferences.
        </p>
        <p>We need people to prepare this type of events, by taking care of logistics, bringing materials, 
          preparing posters, creating information about a project, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>Anyone can contribute something, regardless of background or expertise. 
          For example, if you have a driver's licence and a car, have a nack for preparing snacks or if you are simply sociable, we can use your help!! <abbr title="wink">;-)</abbr>
        </p>
        <p>If you want to participate in one of our events or invite us to an event that you are organising, please contact us.
          We will then create a page dedicated to that event. 
        </p>
        <p>One of the goals of our organisation is spreading and sharing our values. 
          For this reason, it is important that our members participate in this type of activism. 
        </p>
        <p>If you have press contacts, you can use them to get us mentioned in the media.
